    We are dedicated to addressing food insecurity and reducing food waste through innovative technology solutions. Founded with a mission to bridge the gap between surplus food and those in need, our platform empowers individuals and businesses to easily donate excess food to local food banks and shelters. 

    In regions like Karamoja, Uganda, where over 518,000 people are facing critical food insecurity, the need for effective and efficient food distribution systems is more urgent than ever. By leveraging our app, we aim to facilitate the seamless transfer of surplus food to those who need it most, thereby not only alleviating hunger but also promoting sustainable communities.

    Our team comprises passionate individuals committed to making a tangible difference in the fight against famine.
